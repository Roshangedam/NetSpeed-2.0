# NetSpeed 2.0

**NetSpeed 2.0** is a network speed monitoring application that tracks real-time download and upload speeds. With a sleek, customizable interface and system tray integration, it's designed to be lightweight and easy to use while providing essential network performance insights. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Network Speed Monitoring**: Displays live upload and download speeds.
- **Customizable User Interface**: Change font style, font size, and text color.
- **System Tray Integration**: Access app functionality from the system tray.
- **Transparent, Frameless Window**: Place the app anywhere on your screen with a transparent background.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Low system resource consumption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `psutil`: For retrieving system and network statistics.
  - `pystray`: For system tray integration.
  - `Pillow`: For handling images/icons.
  - `pywin32`: For Windows-specific system features.
  - `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface (GUI).
  
### Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install psutil pystray Pillow pywin32
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NetSpeed-2.0.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd NetSpeed-2.0
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The app will now display real-time network speeds in the system tray.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you'll see your real-time network speeds (upload and download) in the transparent window. The system tray icon allows access to a context menu with the following options:

- **Change Font**: Adjust the font style.
- **Change Font Size**: Modify the font size.
- **Change Text Color**: Choose the text color.
- **Toggle Transparency**: Enable/disable the transparent background.
- **Exit**: Close the application.

## Configuration

Settings like font, color, and transparency are saved locally in a configuration file. You can edit this file directly if needed, or reset the settings via the app interface.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

- **Network speeds not showing**: Ensure that your internet connection is active and that the necessary libraries are installed.
- **Settings not saving**: Check the file permissions for the settings configuration file.

If you encounter other issues, please open an issue in the GitHub repository.
